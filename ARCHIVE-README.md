## Idea 1: Contract, Stakeholder & Information Management System for the AECO Industry
The Architecture/Engineering/Construction/Owner industry is rife with lack of trust. Building projects in HCOL cities like NYC run on ambiguity and inefficiency. Stakeholders provide noncommittal or mercurial decisions to avoid traceability. Designers and architects often suffer from miscommunication, misunderstanding, or misrepresentation. Contractors point blame either upward (toward design and engineering teams) or downward (sub-contractors) to avoid liability. Landlords do not intervene in a timely manner, therefore derailing whole project schedules. Normal practice is to now include third-party owner's representatives, who effectively serve as glorified babysitters for upwards of 1-2% of total project cost. Using the blockchain to codify decisions and contracts would greatly reduce inefficiency in overall industry. The blockchain type would depend on the project - government, private sector, education, etc, and metadata could be offered for metric comparison to other projects.
#### Logic:
1. Users agree on contract type and timeline. All parties must be represented. All users must acknowledge.
2. At each decision, users are required to acknowledge and offer feedback.
3. All users must acknowledge.
4. At each milestone, the required users must engage and acknowledge submissions - i.e. engineering team submits drawings, owner must review in timely manner.
5. Repeats until project completion.
## Idea 2: Gamified Practice of Sustainable Life
Sustainability initiatives in practice are missing incentive structures, from both an individual and enterprise perspective. Future calamity is not enough to convince all people and organizations around the world to be a part of a unified solution. This dApp aims to gamify the practice of Sustainable Living with the tracking of an impact point system, defined mathematically by one's environmental footprint in four categories - carbon, water, waste, and consumption (potentially evenutally tied to actual IoT readings). Tokens could be mined by consistent user interaction and low metrics performed by the individual (would need to de-incentivize overmining). At the enterprise level, companies could buy in, thereby establishing social presence and participation on the platform, and offer discounts to individuals that could be exchanged for tokens, effectively "buying" good behavior in exchange for social acceptance and engagement.
#### Logic:
1. Similar to a weight loss app functionality, users would log their footprint on a daily basis.
2. Consistency and lower metrics are rewarded with tokens.
3. Users could trade tokens for a discount or exclusive access to sale.
4. The more tokens a company holds, users intuitively understand the higher commitment they have to sustainable practice.
## Idea 3: Traditionalist Artist/Gallery Buy-In to NFT Space
An education platform encouraging traditionalist artists that work with physical mediums and artforms to tie directly into NFT space, with no prerequesite understanding of the blockchain.
Types of NFT Contracts:
A. NFT owner owns the physical work, and work is then physically sent to them at point of sale.
B. NFT owner owns the physical work, but work is held by the creator, either viewable exclusively or non-exclusively.
C. NFT owner owns the physical work, and work is physically destroyed by the creator.
#### Logic:
1. Users will select type of contract.
2. Users will create digitized version of physical object/artwork.
3. They will mint an NFT with exchange that includes platform processing charge.
4. Contract will execute if all terms are met.
