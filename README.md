# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project
### Certification to: qudoki.eth
## NFT Gallery

A gamified education platform allowing users to move around a single-player perspective space, connect to their Metamask wallets, and purchase NFT's in a visual front-end gallery setting. This encourages traditionalist artists that work with physical mediums and artforms to tie directly into NFT space, with no prerequesite understanding of the blockchain.
#### Logic:
1. User will move around gallery space (arrow keys) and select artwork by pressing space bar.
2. User will connect Metamask wallet.
3. User will show confirmed ownership of NFT.
