## Idea 1: Contract, Stakeholder & Information Management System for the AECO Industry
The Architecture/Engineering/Construction/Owner industry is rife with lack of trust. Building projects in HCOL cities like NYC run on ambiguity and inefficiency. Stakeholders provide noncommittal or mercurial decisions to avoid traceability. Designers and architects often suffer from miscommunication, misunderstanding, or misrepresentation. Contractors point blame either upward (toward design and engineering teams) or downward (sub-contractors) to avoid liability. Normal practice is to now include third-party owner's representatives, who effectively serve as glorified babysitters for upwards of 1-2% of total project cost. 
Blockchain type would depend on the project - government, private sector, education, etc.
Could offer metadata of comparison to other projects.

## Idea 2: Gamified Practice of Sustainable Life
Tracking of carbon point system, companies could buy in - establishing social participation on platform, exchange discounts for tokens.

This exercise allows you to discuss an idea with others and think through some of the implications or program logic without having to code anything yet. Discussing your ideas with instructors, fellows and other colleagues will help you think through the process, identify exciting parts, perhaps surface more challenging areas. It will also help you start to draw a boundary around what you'd like your project to be.  

Last, and more importantly: KEEP IT SUPER SIMPLE (KISS). This is one of the most important software development techniques. It's tempting to want to remake the world with the incredible power of blockchain. However, for this project, it's important to start big and dissolve the ideas down to their most simple, potent essence.

To be sure, the project will be coded in all sorts of amazing languages using awesome blockchain developer tools, but, at this stage, you want to work through the basic problem space and what logic you'll be building. The thinking you do in this step will be a guide, to help keep you moving forward on the right track when things get more complicated. You will be grateful for it later, we promise!

(Note: We'll mention more on this later but you absolutely do not need to write code for this exercise, this will all be written in plain language)

Exercise Parts
The exercise is divided into two parts:
1. Brainstorm on Your Idea In the Discord, or during Office Hours or a study session, we want you to share ideas that you have for a final project. Here are a few things to keep in mind when thinking on and discussing your idea with others:

Explain in a very simple way what you'd like your project to do. It's easy to get complicated with ideas, but the real mental exercise is to dissolve an idea down into its essence. When discussing your idea with people, try to find a few concepts underpinning your idea.

Walk through a single workflow for the future user of your project. Once you have a general idea of what you'd like to do, isolate some of the actions a user will take. Write
You can have a big idea and only work on part of it for your project. You'll be surprised how quickly a "simple" idea can get complicated when you're writing software! Once you have a general idea, isolate two or three essential things a user will do. Those will be a great starting point for your project. If you achieve them quickly, you can move on to the other aspects of your idea!
Pseudocode is a great tool for this exercise When thinking through the actions your future users will take, it can help to write out the steps in plain language! Here's a basic example:
Voting Contract Example Workflow

1. Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract

2. They have to identify which campaign their voting on

3. They'll have to submit a vote for that campaign.

4. They can't vote twice for a single campaign 



2. Upload it to Github Once you have a general sense of your project (Remember: it should be very simple and not complicated!), we'd like you to setup a Github repository for your project and submit your project idea in the repository's README.md file.
